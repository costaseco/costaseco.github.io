            "of software using lightweight techniques like type systems. Sophisticated languages like RUST, OCaml, or Haskell",
            "have characteristics that help developers write correct software. I'm interested in exploring these characteristics",
            "and pushing them further by using techniques like dependent types, refinement types, and type-level programming.",

            "The evolution of software is a complex task. Developers need to understand the code they are changing, and the impact",
            "of their changes. Live programming is a paradigm that aims to help developers in this task by providing immediate feedback",
            "on the impact of their changes. I'm interested in exploring this paradigm in the context of web applications.",

            "Software is not static. It evolves over time. I'm interested in exploring techniques that help developers evolve their",

            "Business process languages are used to describe the flow of data in an organization. However, processes, data and code live in different worlds.",
            "I'm interested in exploring techniques that help developers join these worlds.",

            "I've been working on software security for the last 10 years. I'm interested in making software secure by construction.",

            "and lightweight abstraction mechanims is one interesting topic for me."
